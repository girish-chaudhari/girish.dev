I began my professional journey in 2021 and have since contributed to both service-based and product-based companies, specializing in full-stack web development. My expertise lies primarily in JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems, particularly with React, Next.js, and Node.js. I currently serve as a Senior Software Developer at Visaero, where I lead key projects and mentor fellow engineers.

## Full-time Work

**Visaero** (Sep 2022 – Present)

**Software Developer → Senior Software Developer (Promoted Oct 2024)**

Visaero is a B2B and B2C visa-tech platform offering SaaS and SDK-based visa application solutions.

I have been a core part of building and scaling various modules within the Visaero ecosystem, including:

- **[cp.visaero.com](https://cp.visaero.com/):**  
  Visaero’s internal B2B processing portal that supports multi-role and multi-user workflows for visa management. I worked on:

  - Real-time OCR-based data extraction.
  - Auto-linking of documents to applications.
  - Dynamic form generation with embedded validations.
  - Role-based access control for agents and enterprise users.

- **[commandcenter.com](https://commandcenter.visaero.com/):**  
  A central enterprise dashboard to manage global client organizations, user access, and workflow rules.

- **[travelhub.visaero.com](https://travelhub.visaero.com):**  
  A client-customizable PWA that derives its data from the Visaero processing backend. It allows agencies to manage branding, form flows, and integrations independently.

- **[nofrictionvisaapp.visaero.com](https://nofrictionvisaapp.visaero.com):**  
  A fully B2C-focused product that enables visa application without account creation. Users can initiate applications by scanning a QR code and completing a simple payment summary. It's embeddable and driven by client-managed enterprise configurations.

- **[evm.visaero.com](https://evm.visaero.com):**  
  A secure SDK-style B2B interface inspired by Stripe Connect. This provides enterprise clients with a plug-and-play interface powered by token-authenticated APIs for managing visa workflows within their own systems.

**Responsibilities:**

- Architected scalable frontend systems across all major products.
- Migrated legacy React apps to Next.js for improved performance and routing.
- Led a team of developers post-promotion and coordinated development best practices.
- Contributed to DevOps tasks including build optimizations using Webpack, Vite, and Rspack.
