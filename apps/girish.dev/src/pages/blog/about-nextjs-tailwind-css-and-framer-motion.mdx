import { QuickView } from '@/components/mdx/Link';

Hello everyone! It's already been a week since my last post, [Multiple Reactions in Next.js](/blog/multiple-reactions-feature-in-nextjs).

This time, instead of discussing new features, I want to share my thoughts and experience after using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** for about three months.

Yes, three months! These were the technologies I explored for the **first time** while building this website, which I started around 23rd October 2022.

I’m just sharing from my personal perspective here, not comparing them with similar tech stacks since I haven’t used the others extensively.

Let’s dive in.

## Next.js

Before this, I used to create React websites using CRA (Create React App). I switched to Next.js for this project.

Honestly, Next.js is incredibly convenient. It offers all the features I need out-of-the-box, has great documentation, and the developer experience is smooth.

Some standout features:

### Routing

Routing is built-in, including dynamic routes which are perfect for blogs and similar use-cases.

My favourite part? **API Routes**. You can create API endpoints directly without needing to set up Express.

### MDX Support

Very easy to integrate Markdown and MDX using `@next/mdx`, perfect for blog content or even standard pages.

### Optimization

Fonts and images are optimised by default. You can import Google Fonts easily using `@next/font`, and the Image component provides built-in compression and responsive handling.

Plus, other features like fast compiling, i18n routing, and static HTML export are super handy.

Explore their [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) or just try it out.

## Tailwind CSS

At first, Tailwind CSS looked odd to me. The styling approach felt cluttered.

> “Why is the HTML so messy? Isn’t this similar to inline styles?”

But I had to use it for a freelance project — and I gradually started appreciating it.

Here’s what I love:

- **Write style next to markup** — No need to jump between CSS and HTML files.
- **It’s not inline styles** — You get full control with hover, focus, and responsive styles directly in HTML.
- **Full CSS support** — Gradients, grid, responsive breakpoints, and more are all covered.
- **Editor support** — Extensions like Tailwind Intellisense make writing classes much easier.
- **Shorthand utilities** — Use `inset-0`, `px-4`, `border-y` and more.
- **Dark mode support** — Just use the `dark:` variant.
- **Smaller final CSS** — Only used classes are bundled.

What I didn’t like:

- **Long class names** — I solved this with `clsx()` to keep things readable.

```tsx
<nav
  className={clsx(
    'border-divider-light rounded-xl border bg-white',
    'dark:border-divider-dark dark:bg-slate-900'
  )}
></nav>
```

- **Heavy HTML** — More classes mean heavier HTML, but you can extract repeated styles using `@apply`.

<CodeGroup variant="file">

```html {title:index.html}
<div class="nav-link">Home</div>
<div class="nav-link">Projects</div>
<div class="nav-link">Blog</div>
```

```css {title:styles.css}
.nav-link {
  @apply text-accent-600 flex h-9 items-center gap-1 rounded-xl px-2 text-[13px] font-bold;
  @apply dark:text-accent-400 dark:font-semibold;

  &:hover {
    @apply text-accent-700;
    @apply dark:text-accent-300;
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Framer Motion

When it comes to animations, I previously only used CSS. Framer Motion was my first time animating with JavaScript.

I started with simple transitions like fade-in/fade-out. The API is intuitive and the results are smooth.

It’s very flexible — you can animate onClick, onScroll, when a component enters the viewport, and more.

## Bonus: Hosting on Vercel

I previously used GitHub Pages. Now I host all my Next.js projects on **Vercel**.

- Easy deployment
- Preview environments
- Fast builds
- Free plan

Highly recommended for Next.js apps — especially since Vercel is built by the same creators of Next.js.

## Summary

I genuinely enjoyed working with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Despite being new to this stack, it quickly became my go-to setup for personal and freelance projects.

The developer experience is modern, smooth, and productive.
