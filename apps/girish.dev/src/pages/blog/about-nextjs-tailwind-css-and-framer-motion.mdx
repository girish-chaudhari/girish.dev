import CodeGroup from '@/components/mdx/CodeGroup';
import { QuickView } from '@/components/mdx/Link';

Hello hello, it‚Äôs already been a week since my previous post <QuickView href="/blog/multiple-reactions-feature-in-nextjs">Multiple Reactions Feature</QuickView>.

This time I won't be discussing a new feature, but rather sharing a story about what it's like using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion after around three months.

Yes, three months. All these technologies I used for the **first** time while building this website, which began around 23 October 2022.

It all started from [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/enjidev/status/1583866582798721024).

I'm just sharing based on what I experienced. Not comparing with other similar tech stacks because I haven‚Äôt really used others yet hehe.

Let‚Äôs dive right in..

## Next.js

Previously, when building React websites, I usually used CRA, and only started using Next.js with this website.

Honestly, it‚Äôs really great using Next.js. All the essential features ‚Äî**the ones I need**‚Äî are already provided, the DX is solid, the docs are complete, tutorials are to the point.

The coolest part is support for SSG and SSR. But here are a few features I liked:

### Routing

This is the most important. Routing is supported out-of-the-box. Creating dynamic pages like blogs is very easy.

And what I like most is the API Routes. Creating API endpoints just involves using API Routes, which are already provided. So no need to set up Express again.

### MDX Support

Implementing markdown or mdx for blogging using `@next/mdx` is very easy.

Even for regular pages, so you can definitely create standard pages in mdx format or pages with lots of 'writing' content.

### Optimization

Font and image usage is already optimized by Next.js.

Using Google Fonts just requires importing from the `@next/font` package. For images, it already supports compression and automatic `srcset`.

What‚Äôs not to love?

Actually, there are many small features, like fast compiling, i18n routing, static HTML export, etc.

Do check out the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) or just go ahead and try it out.

## Tailwind CSS

Take a look at this sample code (from the official site [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/)), which uses Tailwind CSS for styling:

```html
<figure class="rounded-xl bg-slate-100 p-8 md:flex md:p-0 dark:bg-slate-800">
  <img
    class="mx-auto h-24 w-24 rounded-full md:h-auto md:w-48 md:rounded-none"
    src="/sarah-dayan.jpg"
    alt=""
    width="384"
    height="512"
  />
  <div class="space-y-4 pt-6 text-center md:p-8 md:text-left">
    <blockquote>
      <p class="text-lg font-medium">
        ‚ÄúTailwind CSS is the only framework that I've seen scale on large teams.
        It‚Äôs easy to customize, adapts to any design, and the build size is
        tiny.‚Äù
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption class="font-medium">
      <div class="text-sky-500 dark:text-sky-400">Sarah Dayan</div>
      <div class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-500">
        Staff Engineer, Algolia
      </div>
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>
```

Initially, I thought:

> why is the styling approach so weird? the HTML looks messy? if it‚Äôs like this, why not just use inline styles?

Ah, so many mixed thoughts üòÇ

But since I got a freelance project that used Tailwind CSS, I had no choice but to use it too.

And it turned out, using Tailwind CSS is quite enjoyable. I tried it and applied it while building this website.

What's good about it?

- **No need to switch files for styling**

  Markup and styles are in the same place. No need to open a CSS file, define class names, search for which class to edit, etc.

  Since styles are embedded in the HTML, creating or updating components is very easy and fast.

  Just open the file, edit the content and edit the styles in the same place üî•

  <br />

- **Different from inline styles**

  My initial thought was wrong, it‚Äôs indeed different from inline styles. Using Tailwind CSS, I can directly style things in the HTML like `hover`, `focus`, etc.

  <br />

- **Full CSS support**

  Almost all CSS features are covered by Tailwind CSS. Creating gradients, backdrop effects, grid, responsive design (breakpoints), etc.

  > So the number of utility classes increases?

  Yes! but if you‚Äôre using VS Code, it becomes very convenient because there‚Äôs a VS Code extension, which shows autocomplete suggestions of Tailwind CSS utility classes while editing HTML classes!

  <br />

- **Shorthand Utilities**

  You can use class `inset-0` which outputs the following CSS:

  ```css {copy:false} {footer:false}
  .inset-0 {
    top: 0px;
    right: 0px;
    bottom: 0px;
    left: 0px;
  }
  ```

  Or many others like `x` and `y` for left+right and top+bottom shorthand. For example `inset-x-0`, `px-2`, `border-y-0` etc.

  <br />

- **Dark mode support**

  Tailwind CSS provides utility classes (variants) like `dark:` which can be used for dark mode styling.

  For example:

  ```html
  <div class="text-black dark:text-white">Hello, World!</div>
  ```

  The text 'Hello, World!' will be black by default and white in dark mode.

  <br />

- **Small CSS output size**

  Since Tailwind CSS bundles only the utility classes you use, the output size is small, depending on how many utilities are used.

  <br />

Any downsides? Of course, there are.

- **Long class names**

  This was quite a debate on Twitter üòÇ But I managed it using `clsx()` to make things a bit neater. It looks like this:

  ```tsx
  <nav
    className={clsx(
      'border-divider-light rounded-xl border bg-white',
      'dark:border-divider-dark dark:bg-slate-900'
    )}
  ></nav>
  ```

  <br />

- **Increased HTML weight**

  Even though the CSS output is small, the HTML output becomes larger. Because long class names add more bytes to the HTML.

  But it can be managed ‚Äî back to the old way ‚Äî where if there are too many classes, especially reused (like in loops), just use a regular CSS class.

  Example case:

  ```html
  <div
    class="text-accent-600 dark:text-accent-400 hover:text-accent-700 hover:dark:text-accent-300 flex h-9 items-center gap-1 rounded-xl px-2 text-[13px] font-bold dark:font-semibold"
  >
    Home
  </div>
  <div
    class="text-accent-600 dark:text-accent-400 hover:text-accent-700 hover:dark:text-accent-300 flex h-9 items-center gap-1 rounded-xl px-2 text-[13px] font-bold dark:font-semibold"
  >
    Projects
  </div>
  <div
    class="text-accent-600 dark:text-accent-400 hover:text-accent-700 hover:dark:text-accent-300 flex h-9 items-center gap-1 rounded-xl px-2 text-[13px] font-bold dark:font-semibold"
  >
    Blog
  </div>
  ```

  I changed it to:

  <CodeGroup variant="file">

  ```html {title:index.html}
  <div class="nav-link">Home</div>
  <div class="nav-link">Projects</div>
  <div class="nav-link">Blog</div>
  ```

  ```css {title:styles.css}
  .nav-link {
    @apply text-accent-600 flex h-9 items-center gap-1 rounded-xl px-2 text-[13px] font-bold;
    @apply dark:text-accent-400 dark:font-semibold;

    &:hover {
      @apply text-accent-700;
      @apply dark:text-accent-300;
    }
  }
  ```

  </CodeGroup>

  This helps reduce the HTML load.

## Framer Motion

Now about animation. I didn‚Äôt use it to build complex animations, just basic ones, like fade-in fade-out.

This was a new experience ‚Äî creating animations using JavaScript. Because earlier, I always used CSS for animations.

How does it feel? Quite nice. The results are smooth. Since it‚Äôs JavaScript-based, it‚Äôs also easier to animate through specific events.

For example, like `onClick`, `onScroll`, when a component is first rendered, or even when an element becomes ‚Äòvisible‚Äô in the viewport.

## Bonus Point

1. **Vercel**

   Previously, I only used GitHub Pages, because it was just for static pages (using CRA). Now I use Vercel for hosting this Next.js project.

   > Vercel is the platform for frontend developers, providing the speed and reliability innovators need to create at the moment of inspiration.
   >
   > ‚Äî [vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/)

   Deployment setup is not complicated, fast, staging features like development or preview mode for the site (so it doesn‚Äôt deploy directly to production), and of course, there‚Äôs a free plan.

   Recommended hosting for Next.js projects, especially because Next.js is owned by Vercel üòÇ

## Summary

It‚Äôs been fun and enjoyable using Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion. The developer experience is excellent, easy to use, and the documentation is well-structured.

Although I‚Äôm still relatively new to it, I think this tech stack is going to be my first choice when creating a website.

That‚Äôs all for now ‚Äî stay healthy and see you next week üëã
