Tomorrow is my birthday, and I’m creating this blog on 14th June 2025.

Even if it's a bit late, I’m looking forward to making some changes in my life to get more reliable resources and higher income.  
After working fully on a recent B2B project, I’ve gained multiple ideas from it — and I plan to continue developing them.

## Throwback to My 2024 Changes Before My Birthday

I learned a lot over the past year. I got a chance to explore various Git repositories — studying real-world codebases helped me gain performance-oriented insights and practical ideas. I will definitely keep doing this more actively.

Here are some of the key points:

> - Focusing on what’s going on in the IT world
> - Staying active in IT culture and tech news
> - Made a few changes and improvements to my setup
>
> I’m still preparing to launch my ideas as a SaaS-based product.

Awesome, right? So where am I now? How’s it going?

Honestly, I’m thrilled to be writing this retrospective because a number of those goals have been achieved! Let’s dive in!

## Remote Work

This was the biggest achievement of the year! Yuhuuu, I finally started working remotely! 🤩

In January 2023, I received a wave of job offers from international companies.

It all started because I was **active and regularly shared updates about this website on X/Twitter**, which led to offers coming in via Twitter DMs, LinkedIn messages, and emails.

It was nerve-wracking to receive so many offers — especially since most were from overseas companies, and it was my first experience handling this, with my English still being shaky. I was also worried about potential scams and other uncertainties.

I received more than 20 job offers in just the first month! Alhamdulillah. One by one, doors began to open.

That said, I was very selective and meticulous in choosing roles that aligned with my expertise and interest — aiming for a role that respected my technical background and helped maintain professionalism.

### CKCollab

It started with a landing page project for a [web agency](https://ckcollab.com/), CKCollab — a US-based company.

The client requested a Gmeet, but I explained that I wasn’t very fluent in English.

I took the plunge anyway, and Alhamdulillah the client was understanding. My first Gmeet with an international client went smoothly and left a lasting impression.

Eventually, we agreed to begin the project. And just like that, I received my first dollar income from remote work 🥲

The project ran for about two months. While I was working on it, another offer came in:

### Xyvo Technologies

This one was special. The offer actually came in January, but I only responded in February. And the phrase "if it's meant to be, it will find its way" really held true here.

Unlike the previous client who wanted a video call, this one directly sent me three questions via text.

They were basic — things like whether I’d used technologies A, B, and C, and for how long. I responded honestly: some yes, some no 😅 and the final question was about salary expectations.

I answered all three, and shortly afterward, they sent me an NDA to sign — and then it was a done deal. I thought, “Is this a scam?”

But no — they soon asked for an invoice to pay in advance. I quickly created one, added the payment link, and ping! I got the notification: dollars received. Alhamdulillah, clients like this are a blessing 🥲

At Xyvo Technologies, I worked on several exciting projects aligned with my interests — especially **web apps**. There were many detailed UI components to design, which made the work very enjoyable!

As of writing this, I’m still working at Xyvo Technologies, and as of **February 2024, it’s been a full year** 😁

> What’s so great about working remotely?

It’s absolutely enjoyable and fulfilling!

Based on a full year of experience — particularly at Xyvo Technologies — the team has been incredibly welcoming and friendly to newcomers.

They’ve been supportive, appreciative, and provided feedback in a respectful, encouraging manner.

For me personally, working remotely has brought tremendous benefits to my day-to-day life.

My office is five steps away, no transportation costs, no stress from traffic, more time with family, coffee breaks can be aligned with work hours, and if there’s something urgent, I can simply pause and resume later.

And most importantly, the pay is significantly better. At Xyvo, I even received a bonus to help set up my work equipment.

> So what’s important when working remotely?

**Work hours and communication!**

You need to adapt to client time zones — sometimes quite different from IST. Fortunately, some clients offer flexible hours.

Still, remote work doesn’t mean doing things your own way. Professionalism and accountability are key.

Also, make sure you have adequate equipment and a stable internet connection. It doesn’t have to be perfect — just sufficient to support smooth work and communication.

## New Skill Unlocked

Another milestone was gaining new skills and knowledge.

After a year at Xyvo Technologies, I became familiar with a new stack: **Vue**.

I’d been a React developer since 2016 — but this time, I took up the challenge of learning Vue for work. Surprisingly, the developer experience is quite nice! 😅

## Building a PC

Finally! After wishing for this since 2022, I built my custom PC in 2023!

I started buying parts in April 2022 — case, fan, PSU, and processor. Then had to pause for budget reasons (and because I got a backup PC from my previous company) 🥲

Thankfully, after earning my first remote income, I resumed in February 2023 — buying GPU, RAM, motherboard, and other parts. By March 2023, all components were ready!

Assembled everything right away. **My first PC build** — such a fun experience. Took a full night, handled everything carefully, referred to manuals and tutorials whenever I got confused.

And the most surprising part? I got it to work on the first try — it booted right up! All components were detected. What a proud moment 😅

## Workspace

Since our house was being renovated, I decided to refresh my workspace as well.

Can’t have a new PC without a new workspace, right? Hehe ✌️

You can see the full setup on my [Studio page](/work/studio)

## SaaS Idea

Unfortunately, I couldn’t realise my goal of launching a SaaS product in 2023 🥲

But I do have several ideas ready — hopefully, I can bring them to life this year! Wish me luck!

## Others

Other fun things outside of work goals 😁

### Dream Motorcycle

After my previous bike was totaled in an accident, I decided to buy a new one — finally!

Can you guess which one? 👀

Still not sure? I gave it away in the alt text 😄

### Engagement Day

07 June 2023. The most beautiful day of 2023.

### Renovating My Parents' House

This was a big experience for me. I managed the entire renovation with my uncle, who happened to be the contractor.

From budget planning and space layout to selecting materials — I learnt so much about home renovation.

Alhamdulillah, after around 6 months, the house was fully renovated 🙂

### Aqiqah

19 November 2023. Yes, my own aqiqah — at the age of twenty-something 🙏 Alhamdulillah, may it be accepted by Allah. A truly memorable moment.

### New Devices

I bought a lot of devices in 2023. Mostly to support my work (mostly Apple gear): MacBook, AirPods, iPad, Apple Pencil, Apple Watch, and a 34" Curved Monitor (Xiaomi).

This was my first time going all-in on the Apple ecosystem, and it was fantastic. The user experience was simply top-notch.

But my favourite purchases were gaming-related: PS5, a 65" 4K Samsung TV, Logitech G29, and my go-to game: Forza Horizon 5 (PC). It’s so relaxing to drive around virtually after a long coding session 😅

No idea how much I spent last year 🥲 but I made sure everything supported my productivity — except the gaming gear, which was more of a reward and for entertainment 🥲

## What's Next for 2024

That wraps up my 2023 journey. There were many more small but meaningful achievements that I didn’t mention — I’ll keep those private ✌

So, what are my goals for 2024?

The major ones are the same: **launching a SaaS** and **continuing remote work** — I hope I can stick to those.

And one new goal — this year, I want to **become fitter and reach my ideal weight**.

A few smaller plans include revamping this personal site and maybe even starting a webtoon series to sharpen my drawing and storytelling skills 😅

Thank you for reading this far. I hope we’re all blessed with health and time to meet again in next year’s post.

Cheers to 2024!
