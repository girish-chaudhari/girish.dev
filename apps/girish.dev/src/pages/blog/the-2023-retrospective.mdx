Happy New Year 2024! This is my annual retrospective—a look back at what 2023 brought professionally and personally. It’s been a year of deep learning, new challenges, and some proud milestones.

---

## Starting Strong with Remote Work 🌍

One of the most defining aspects of 2023 was the transition to **full-time remote work**. It gave me the opportunity to collaborate with international teams and contribute meaningfully from the comfort of my home workspace in India.

I worked with multiple clients and teams across the globe, but one of the most impactful was my long-term engagement with a company focused on **visa application technologies**. The project involved building highly dynamic forms, deeply integrated workflows, and robust UI components—all powered by **Next.js**, **React**, **ShadCN**, and **TailwindCSS**.

---

## My Tech Stack in 2023 🛠️

Throughout the year, I focused on refining my skills in the following areas:

- **Next.js (App Router)** with Server Components & Server Actions
- **React Query**, **Zod**, **React Hook Form** for dynamic forms & validation
- **ShadCN + Tailwind CSS** for UI systems and theming
- **Turborepo** for managing a multi-package monorepo
- **Custom SDK integrations** for multi-tenant applications
- **Context API + Zustand** for scoped, reactive state management

I also spent time designing reusable component libraries in a shared `@workspace/ui` package to standardize UI/UX across multiple portals (B2B, B2C, SDK-based).

## Project Highlights 🚀

### 🛂 Visa Application Platform

Built a fully dynamic visa application form that renders UI based on a DB-driven schema, with intelligent sectioning, field grouping, and conditionally rendered input types. It also handled:

- Contextual document upload with OCR preview
- Role-based access and permissions
- Complex validation logic for nested applicant data

### 💳 Payment Summary Engine

Implemented a modular summary interface that:

- Aggregates totals per applicant, currency, and payment method
- Supports online, wallet, offline, and SDK-based payments
- Integrates a form ref system to trigger form submission externally

### 📦 Shared Component Architecture

Designed a `common-ui` package to sit atop `@workspace/ui`, allowing for rapid development with consistent design tokens and component variants used across different products (internal portal, iframe SDKs, and external clients).

## My Workstation Setup 🧰

In 2023, I upgraded to a more flexible and productive development environment that suits my full-stack workflow.

### 💻 Devices I Use

- **MacBook Pro M2** – My primary device for most front-end and cloud-related work.
- **Windows PC** – Still part of my daily workflow, especially for testing cross-platform issues and managing heavier workloads.
- I regularly switch between macOS and Windows, depending on the task—macOS for development and UNIX-based tools, and Windows for legacy projects, browser compatibility, and occasional gaming.

### 🖥️ Dual-Environment Workflow

Managing both environments has helped me stay versatile and efficient. I rely heavily on CLI tools and cross-terminal workflows that sync smoothly between macOS and Windows.

On top of that, I manage a **self-hosted Ubuntu server**, which acts as my personal deployment/testing instance. I use it to:

- Run background services (e.g., Node, PostgreSQL, Nginx)
- Test remote deployments before pushing to production
- Run Dockerized builds and backups

### ⚙️ Vim + CLI Skills

Over the past year, I also picked up the basics of **Vim**, which has greatly improved my terminal efficiency—especially when editing config files, working in SSH sessions, or doing quick edits directly on the Ubuntu server.

I'm still exploring deeper Vim features, but for now I’m comfortable with:

- Navigation and editing
- File splits
- Basic macros
- Search and replace

This command-line confidence has translated into smoother DevOps practices and faster debugging across all platforms.

## Personal Projects 🧪

While client work kept me quite busy, I also made progress on personal tools and ideas:

### 🔧 Build & Deploy Automation

I automated my React app build and deploy process using Node.js scripting:

- Semantic versioning & tagging
- Zipping build artifacts with custom naming
- Email & Teams notification support
- Plans to rewrite the workflow in **Rust** for performance and binary distribution

### 🧠 SaaS Experiments

I prototyped a few internal tools that may eventually turn into SaaS offerings—one around dynamic schema-based forms and another focused on multi-tenant management. Still early stage, but promising!

---

## Challenges Faced 🧱

Like any year, 2023 had its fair share of challenges:

- Managing **timezone differences** with remote teams
- Debugging deeply nested state structures in dynamic forms
- Preventing over-fetching and re-renders in complex apps
- Balancing multiple projects without burning out

But every challenge helped me grow as a developer and taught me better architectural thinking.

---

## What’s Next for 2024? 🔮

Looking ahead, my top goals are:

- **Launch my first SaaS product**
- **Stay consistent with my learning**, especially in the areas of Rust, AI-assisted dev tools, and backend architecture
- **Improve design skills** and storytelling through visual content
- Stay fit and achieve a healthier work-life balance

Thanks for reading through my 2023 journey. Whether it was learning a new stack, shipping meaningful features, or simply enjoying the beauty of remote work—this year has been truly fulfilling.

Here's to building and learning even more in 2024! 🚀
