Tomorrow is my birthday, and I‚Äôm creating this blog on 14th June 2025.

Even if it's a bit late, I‚Äôm looking forward to making some changes in my life to get more reliable resources and higher income.  
After working fully on a recent B2B project, I‚Äôve gained multiple ideas from it ‚Äî and I plan to continue developing them.

## Throwback to My 2024 Changes Before My Birthday

I learned a lot over the past year. I got a chance to explore various Git repositories ‚Äî studying real-world codebases helped me gain performance-oriented insights and practical ideas. I will definitely keep doing this more actively.

Here are some of the key points:

> - Focusing on what‚Äôs going on in the IT world
> - Staying active in IT culture and tech news
> - Made a few changes and improvements to my setup
>
> I‚Äôm still preparing to launch my ideas as a SaaS-based product.

Awesome, right? So where am I now? How‚Äôs it going?

Honestly, I‚Äôm thrilled to be writing this retrospective because a number of those goals have been achieved! Let‚Äôs dive in!

## &#x20;Career Growth

2023 was a defining year. Though I started my career in 2021, this year marked a full-circle evolution in my journey ‚Äî from my first job at an IT company in Surat (through IIT Kolkata) to now working on complex B2B and SDK-based architectures at Visaero in Pune.

Initially, I worked on multiple stacks ‚Äî beginning with Node.js and later shifting to React.js. In my first year alone, I was exposed to **3‚Äì5 different technologies**, which laid the foundation for a strong full-stack profile.

After completing a year in Surat, I moved to **Pune** to join **Visaero**, a visa technology firm, where I embraced the role of a full-time software developer. I began contributing to core projects, including:

- **B2B** portal
- **B2C** modules
- **Embedded¬†SDK** ‚Äî a frictionless visa application flow via QR
- Scanning-based transaction flows
- Embedded SDKs for enterprises

Visaero gave me the opportunity to explore not just frontend work with React and Next.js, but also deeper backend concepts, server configuration, DNS routing, and NGINX-based load handling.

## What‚Äôs Great About Working Here?

Working at Visaero exposed me to many new things:

- React, Node.js, Next.js
- Webpack, API gateway handling
- Server management, NGINX configuration
- DNS and proxy rules

I even got to experience infrastructure-level work that sharpened my skills beyond typical frontend/backend boundaries.

Today, I serve as a **tech lead**, building scalable architecture while mentoring juniors and owning key product pipelines. The learning never stops.

## New Skill Unlocked

The biggest achievement in skill acquisition this year was becoming proficient in full-stack engineering and backend infra. Also, I explored the early ideas of building **SaaS and AI-based solutions** ‚Äî including:

- Multi-tenant SaaS design
- SDK distribution models
- Embeddable UIs
- Serverless function patterns

Though I couldn‚Äôt launch a product this year, my research and understanding of **enterprise-grade SaaS platforms** improved drastically.

## Building My Custom PC

2023 was also the year I finally built my own custom PC from scratch. It was a long-time dream ‚Äî started gathering parts in 2022 and completed the build by March 2023.

This system became my main workstation for work and learning. A memorable night of assembling, wiring, BIOS configurations ‚Äî and it booted perfectly on the first try üòÖ

## Workspace & Office

Since my house was under renovation, I also redesigned my workspace. My office is currently based in **WDC, Tower 2, Pune** ‚Äî and the atmosphere there is ideal for focused tech work.

## Dream Motorcycle

After years of dreaming and surviving a crash that totaled my previous bike, I finally got myself a new motorcycle this year üèçÔ∏è

It‚Äôs not just a vehicle, but a reward for the grind and growth over the past couple of years.

## SaaS Ideas Brewing

Although I didn‚Äôt launch my SaaS in 2023, I‚Äôve been shaping the vision and planning out:

- AI Agent integration
- Tenant-aware data routing
- Analytics dashboards
- API-first design

These ideas are evolving into real plans in 2024.

## Goals for 2024

- Launch a SaaS product
- Open-source contributions in JS/TS
- Explore Rust & low-level performance fixes
- Build libraries/tools that help scale enterprise tech
- Participate in community forums
- Fix open GitHub issues across full-stack problems

I‚Äôm also planning to double down on **fitness** and stay consistent.
