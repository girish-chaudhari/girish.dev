Hello there! Already using or planning to try **Tailwind CSS**? Then youâ€™ve landed at the right place. In this post, Iâ€™ll be sharing a few important practices and coding styles that have helped me use Tailwind CSS more comfortably and efficiently.

Strictly speaking, these arenâ€™t necessarily "best practices," but rather my personal approach and styling conventions â€” hopefully, you find something helpful.

## Coding Style

Hereâ€™s how I structure my Tailwind CSS classes â€” I typically focus on three areas: sorting, splitting, and grouping.

### Sorting

Take a look at this `Button` component example â€” the class list is quite long ðŸ˜‚

```html
<button
  class="inline-flex h-10 items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border border-transparent bg-purple-600 px-4 text-center text-sm font-bold text-white transition duration-150 hover:bg-purple-700 md:rounded-xl dark:bg-purple-600 dark:hover:bg-purple-500"
>
  Button Text
</button>
```

When dealing with long utility chains, sorting classes becomes quite important.

Thankfully, Tailwind CSS provides a [Prettier plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) that helps auto-sort these classes.

Consistent class ordering makes future maintenance much easier.

In the example above, `border` and `border-transparent` are next to each other, making it easier to modify border-related styles.

Likewise, `hover:` and breakpoint-specific classes like `md:` are typically easier to locate when consistently placed.

### Splitting

To make things neater, I usually split the classes into multiple strings/lines. I personally use [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) for this purpose.

Here's a cleaner version of the same `Button` component:

```tsx
function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex h-10 items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border border-transparent bg-purple-600 px-4 text-center text-sm font-bold text-white transition duration-150 hover:bg-purple-700 md:rounded-xl',
        'dark:bg-purple-600 dark:hover:bg-purple-500'
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Grouping

Once split, grouping helps improve readability. Hereâ€™s the pattern I usually follow:

- **Group 1:** Default utilities
- **Group 2:** Breakpoints (e.g., `md:`)
- **Group 3:** Dark mode variants
- **Group 4:** Other variants like `hover:`

Applied to the same button:

```tsx
function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={clsx(
        // group 1
        'inline-flex h-10 items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border border-transparent bg-purple-600 px-4 text-center text-sm font-bold text-white transition duration-150',
        // group 2
        'md:rounded-xl',
        // group 3
        'dark:bg-purple-600 dark:hover:bg-purple-500',
        // group 4
        'hover:bg-purple-700'
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

The same applies when using CSS classes:

```css
.button {
  /* group 1 */
  @apply inline-flex h-10 items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border border-transparent bg-purple-600 px-4 text-center text-sm font-bold text-white transition duration-150;
  /* group 2 */
  @apply md:rounded-xl;
  /* group 3 */
  @apply dark:bg-purple-600 dark:hover:bg-purple-500;
  /* group 4 */
  @apply hover:bg-purple-700;
}
```

Feel free to adjust or expand the groups based on your own preference â€” the key is consistency.

## Tips

### Use Reusable Components

If multiple elements share common styling (like buttons), consider extracting them into reusable components.

Since I use React, I often write something like:

```tsx
function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex h-10 items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border border-transparent bg-purple-600 px-4 text-center text-sm font-bold text-white transition duration-150',
        'md:rounded-xl',
        'dark:bg-purple-600 dark:hover:bg-purple-500',
        'hover:bg-purple-700'
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Use Class-Based Styling (for Static Sites)

Especially useful when building static sites â€” utility-heavy HTML can become bloated quickly. Using class components can reduce output size.

Hereâ€™s an example with multiple pagination buttons using repetitive styles:

```html
<button
  class="inline-flex h-10 items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border border-transparent bg-purple-600 px-4 text-center text-sm font-bold text-white transition duration-150 hover:bg-purple-700 md:rounded-xl dark:bg-purple-600 dark:hover:bg-purple-500"
>
  1
</button>
<!-- repeated for 2, 3, 4, etc. -->
```

Now, using a class component:

<CodeGroup variant="file">

```html {title:index.html}
<button class="pagination-button">1</button>
<button class="pagination-button">2</button>
<!-- and so on -->
```

```css {title:styles.css}
.pagination-button {
  @apply inline-flex h-10 items-center justify-center gap-1.5 rounded-md border border-transparent bg-purple-600 px-4 text-center text-sm font-bold text-white transition duration-150;
  @apply md:rounded-xl;
  @apply dark:bg-purple-600 dark:hover:bg-purple-500;
  @apply hover:bg-purple-700;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

I've already talked about this in a previous post â€” <QuickView href="/blog/about-nextjs-tailwind-css-and-framer-motion">see this section</QuickView> (HTML load performance).

### Avoid `!important`

Like in regular CSS, try to avoid using `!important` in Tailwind. It can lead to maintenance issues.

Tailwind allows `!important` via the `!` prefix: `!p-2 !px-3`. Avoid overusing it.

Once you start using it, it often creeps into other classes and becomes difficult to manage.

### Conditional Class Names

{/\* prettier-ignore-start \*/}

<Dont>
  ```tsx
  <div className={`text-black ${dark && 'text-white'}`}>Hello, World!</div>
  ```
</Dont>
<Do>
  ```tsx
  <div className={dark ? 'text-white' : 'text-black'}>Hello, World!</div>
  ```
</Do>

{/\* prettier-ignore-end \*/}

Let me explain.

In the first example, if `dark` is true, the result is `text-black text-white` â€” which might cause issues since CSS specificity determines which one takes precedence.

Depending on the build order, your text may still appear black even though `text-white` is present â€” because `text-black` might be loaded after it.

Use ternary conditions to avoid this kind of issue.
